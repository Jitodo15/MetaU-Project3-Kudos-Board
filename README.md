### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed really helped me with this week's project especially the lab/class we had on databases (prisma). I did not feel prepared to cover the user authentication because I was unfamiliar with it and did not have enough time to research on that topic.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have improved my UI, I spent most of my time on the functionality which is what I often prioritize during a project and try to use the time left to improve my UI. I also would have completed the stretch feature on user authentication.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I noticed the way people made their user interface, I feel like I could have made better design choices.
